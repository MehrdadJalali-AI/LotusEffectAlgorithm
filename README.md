This repository contains various directories, each with specific files and functionalities related to our research and development. Here's a detailed explanation of each directory:

## 1. LEA
This directory contains the primary single-objective algorithm implemented as part of our research.

## 2. LEA-EMO
This folder includes our proposed multi-modal algorithm along with the "hill-valley" functions used in the paper. It is designed to handle and demonstrate multi-modal optimization techniques.

## 3. Other test game
This directory includes various test games that are executable and represent different gaming scenarios or algorithms in action.

## 4. Run in test
This folder is divided into three subfolders:
- **fig result**: Contains MATLAB-generated images that demonstrate the multimodality of the results.
- **EMo-LEA**: Includes executable functions specific to multi-modal operations, along with their respective output images and execution displays.
- **function**: Houses multiple multi-modal functions utilized in our simulations and analyses.

## 5. Test function
Here you will find various functions used across our research, including those specifically designed for multi-modal operations that have been employed in our work.

## 6. Test game
This folder contains definitions and implementations for four games that have been developed and tested as part of our research initiatives.

Each directory is structured to support specific aspects of our research and development in algorithmic studies and gaming simulations. For further details on each file's usage and implementation, refer to the individual documents within each directory.

## Lotus effect optimization algorithm (LEA): a lotus nature-inspired algorithm for engineering design optimization
Here we introduce a new evolutionary algorithm called the Lotus Effect Algorithm, which combines efficient operators from the dragonfly algorithm, such as the movement of dragonflies in flower pollination for exploration, with the self-cleaning feature of water on flower leaves known as the lotus effect, for extraction and local search operations. The authors compared this method to other improved versions of the dragonfly algorithm using standard benchmark functions, and it outperformed all other methods according to Fredman's test on 29 benchmark functions. The article also highlights the practical application of LEA in reducing energy consumption in IoT nodes through clustering, resulting in increased packet delivery ratio and network lifetime. Additionally, the performance of the proposed method was tested on real-world problems with multiple constraints, such as the welded beam design optimization problem and the speed-reducer problem applied in a gearbox, and the results showed that LEA performs better than other methods in terms of accuracy.
